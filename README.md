The **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator** repository is part of the **Data Analysis with Python** course on FreeCodeCamp. The project involves creating a Python function that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a 3x3 matrix (represented as a list of lists).

### Key Features:
1. **Input**: The function takes in a list of 9 numbers, which are reshaped into a 3x3 matrix.
2. **Output**: The function returns a dictionary containing:
   - Mean, variance, and standard deviation for each row and column of the matrix.
   - Mean, variance, and standard deviation for the entire matrix.
3. **Libraries**: The project typically uses `NumPy` to handle matrix operations and calculations.
4. **Structure**: The repository includes:
   - A Python script for the solution.
   - Unit tests to ensure the function behaves as expected with various inputs.
   - Documentation and instructions on how to use and run the project.
This project helps learners get familiar with basic matrix operations, statistical calculations, and how to manipulate data using Python.
